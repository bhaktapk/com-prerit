    <h1><span>Login! Why?</span></h1>
    <p>
        For the photos! If you're a friend or family member of either of me or my wife, you'll definitely want to view the photos
        we have gathered over the years. Whether you talk to us daily or not, it's good to keep in touch and see what is going.
    </p>
    <h1><span>But How?</span></h1>
    <p>
        Look to your right! Almost every page on this site has that widget so you're never too far from it. If you are a friend
        or family member, you should create an account but be warned, you'll need to prove that you know either me or my wife but
        answering some easy questions. If for some reason you don't know the answer, it's not hard to <a id="contactLink" href="~/contact/" title=""
        runat="server">get ahold of me</a>.
